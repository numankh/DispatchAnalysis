## Optimizing and Predicting Emergency Calls in San Francisco

The purpose of this project was to analyze and display trends in public data from the San Francisco Fire Department that contained dispatch information for emergency calls, with call time, location, dispatch. 


### Question 1

Data Visuals: Display or graph 3 metrics or trends from the data set that are interesting to you.

When looking at all of the dispatch data provided, I was interested in specifically analyzing the timestamp data. One of the goals for this project was optimization of the dipatch process. Therefore, I was eager to depict three trends that had to do with the amount of time different parts of the dispatch process took. The trends I looked into were the amount of time an operator takes to dispatch an emergency vehicle, the amount of time a unit takes from receiving a dispatch to arriving on scene, and the amount of time an ambulance takes to reach the nearest hospital.

### Question 2

Given an address and time, what is the most likely dispatch to be required?

### Question 3

Which areas take the longest time to dispatch to on average? How can this be reduced?
